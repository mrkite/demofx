    <h1>Oldschool Demo Effects</h1>
    <div>
      <div>
        <p>
        This is a small collection of oldschool demo effects.  These effects
        all use direct pixel manipulation to achieve their result.  None of
        them use any hardware acceleration, or anything more advanced than a
        simple array of pixel data.
        </p>
        <p>
        All effects are written in typescript.  You can view the source on
        <a href="https://github.com/mrkite/demofx">github</a>.
        I also link to each individual effect alongside the demos below.

    <h2>RotoZoom</h2>
    <div>
      <div>
        <p>
        The rotozoom is a simple effect that goes through each pixel on the
        screen and maps the coordinate of that pixel backwards through a
        sin/cos transform to determine which coordinate of the source image
        to use.  By applying a scale to that transform you also achieve the
        zooming part of the rotozoom effect.  Finally, the source coordinate
        is wrapped using modulo to give a tiling effect.
        </p>

      </div>
    </div>

    <h2>Fire</h2>
    <div>
      <div>
        <p>The fire effect is a classic.  The way it works is with an array
        of color indices into a palette.  The palette is arranged so that it
        fades from black at the bottom of the palette, to orangish red in
        the higher indices.  On each frame, the array is traversed and each
        pixel is averaged with adjacent pixels.  It is then darkened slighly
        so that the pixels on higher rows are darker than the ones below it.
        The bottom row (just offscreen) is filled with random indices.  This
        becomes the fuel of the fire effect.</p>
        <p>Because the fire is darkened by a constant value, the fire is
        limited vertically.  The classic fire effect is optimized for 55
        pixels high.  I do the same here, using the canvas to scale the
        output.</p>

        <canvas id="fire" width="80" height="50" style="width: 640px; height:
        400px" />
      </div>
    </div>

    <h2>Plasma</h2>
    <div>
      <div>
        <p>
        There are many versions of plasma.  This particular version is a
        paletteless plasma which is created by adding multiple sin waves
        together, combined with distortion generated doing things like
        calculating the distance between pixels.
        </p>
        <p>
        The color is determined by assigning different parts of the plasma
        to different color channels.  Because I use the frame time for the
        inputs to the various functions, the plasma will distort and simplify
        given enough time.
        </p>

        <a href="https://github.com/mrkite/demofx/blob/master/src/plasma.ts">here</a>.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div>
        <input type="button" onclick="toggle('plasma', this)" value="Run" />
        <canvas id="plasma" width="640" height="400" />
      </div>
    </div>

    <h2>Metablobs</h2>
    <div>
      <div>
        <p>
        To draw this effect, we loop through each pixel and calculate the
        distance from that pixel to each blob.  Then we multiply all these
        distances together and divide by a constant.  Then we subtract this
        value from another constant, and clamp the result.  How we choose the
        various constants determines how big the blobs are and how fuzzy they
        are.
        </p>
        <p>
        Changing the number of blobs or the resolution of the screen requires
        a lot of hand-adjusting the constants to give a good effect.
        </p>
        <p>
        The blobs can move around however you like.  I just have them running
        in various lissajous curves.
        </p>
        <p>
        You can view the source
        <a href="https://github.com/mrkite/demofx/blob/master/src/blobs.ts">here</a>.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div>
        <input type="button" onclick="toggle('blob', this)" value="Run" />
        <canvas id="blob" width="640" height="400" />
      </div>
    </div>

    <h2>Tunnel</h2>
    <div>
      <div>
        <p>
        The tunnel effect is accomplished by using 3 arrays, each the size
        of the screen.  The first array contains the distance from that pixel
        to the center of the screen, scaled and modulated by the height of
        the texture.  The second array contains the angle from that pixel
        to the center of the screen.  The third array contains a clamped
        distance from the center of the screen.
        </p>
        <p>
        These arrays are calculated only once.  Then they are used to calculate
        the coordinates of the texture.  The first array determines the
        x coordinate of the texture.  The second array determines the y
        coordinate.  The third array determines how to darken the texture so
        that the center of the tunnel is blackened.
        </p>
        <p>
        Finally, to pan the center of the tunnel around, we actually make
        the arrays twice the screen size and simply pan around the arrays.
        </p>
        <p>

        </p>
      </div>
      <div>
        <input type="button" onclick="toggle('tunnel', this)" value="Run" />
        <canvas id="tunnel" width="640" height="400" />
      </div>
    </div>
    <h2>Moire</h2>
    <div>
      <div>
        <p>
        The moire effect is rather simple.  You have two points that act as the
        foci of the moire effect.  For each pixel, you calculate the
        distances from that pixel to both points.  XOR these distances together,
        and then divide by the desired ring width.  If the result is odd, make
        it one color, otherwise another color.  This produces the moire effect.
        </p>
        <p>
        Again, you can move the foci points however you want, I again have them
        running in lissajous curves.
        </p>

        <canvas id="moire" width="640" height="400" />
      </div>
    </div>
    <h2>Rain</h2>
    <div>
      <div>
        <p>
        The rain effect is deviously simple.  There are two arrays the size
        of the screen.  Each element in the arrays represent the amplitiude of
        the wave at that location.  The algorithm takes the previous array and
        averages the surrounding amplitudes and subtracts the current amplitude
        from that.  Then the new amplitude is dampened in order to make the
        ripples die off.  Then the arrays are swapped.  This actually causes
        the amplitude to oscillate like a wave.
        We then use the amplitude to distort our texture, calculating the
        delta amplitude from left to right and top to bottom.  These deltas
        are then used to modify the texture's coordinates and darken the
        resulting pixel.
